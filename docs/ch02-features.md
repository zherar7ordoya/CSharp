A few minor improvements, like automatic disposal at the end of `foreach` statements, was released with Visual Studio .NET 2003.

# C# 2, 2005

Enabled strong data typing using generics, to improve code performance and reduce type errors, including the topics listed in *Table 2.1*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Dynamic types|2|Storing dynamic types
Named/optional arguments|5|Optional parameters and named arguments

*Table 2.3: Features of C# 3 covered in this book*

# C# 5, 2012

Simplified asynchronous operation support by automatically implementing complex state machines while writing what looks like synchronous statements, including the topics listed in *Table 2.4*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Simplified asynchronous tasks|2|Understanding `async` and `await`

*Table 2.4: Features of C# 5 covered in this book*

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Binary literals and digit separators|2|Storing whole numbers
Pattern matching|3|Pattern matching with the `if` statement
`out` variables|5|Controlling how parameters are passed
