# How to get a Packt book as a PDF

You have two options to get a Packt book in PDF format:

1. If you purchase any other format of the book from anywhere else then you can get the PDF edition by completing a form on Packt's website with proof of purchase: https://www.packtpub.com/page/free-ebook. For example, you might buy the paperback from your local independent bookstore, or you might buy the Kindle edition from Amazon.

2. If you purchase an ebook from Packt's website then you get it in PDF and EPUB formats as well as their online reader.

# Will there be .NET 9 editions of your other books?

Although I have updated my C# and .NET fundamentals book and created a new book for web development that both cover .NET 9, I will not be updating my *Apps and Services* or *Tools and Skills* books until .NET 10. 

Until the end of 2025, the most up-to-date editions of my .NET books are shown in the following figure:

Starting in November 2025, my plan* is that all four .NET books will be updated for .NET 10, shown in the following figure:
